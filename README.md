# Mathematical Modelling in Physiology and Medicine 2021 Coursework

This repository contains the Python code to reproduce the figures in the coursework for [EMATM0007: Mathematical Modelling in Physiology and Medicine](https://www.bris.ac.uk/unit-programme-catalogue/UnitDetails.jsa;jsessionid=557B7CD21C5BEDD4093DA92C0DA5C5F4?ayrCode=31%2F32&unitCode=EMATM0007) by Vedang Joshi.

In this work, we conduct a model comparison and analysis on the paper [Minimal model for signal-induced Ca2+ oscillations and for their frequency encoding through protein phosphorylation](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/87/4/1461.full.pdf). We introduce the biological model in terms of a system of ODEs and compare model approaches to ones found in the literature. We conduct show how the system dynamics change in time for various parameter sets. We give a phase plane analysis to qualitatively determine features in the non-linear system. We end by conducting a bifurcation analysis on the system of ODEs. 

## Requirements

## Comments
Reproduction of figure 6 may be done using the corresponding code but requires parallelisation and the use of multiple cores. For ease of reproduction, we recommend using the pickle files as given and instead using .... to reproduce figure 6.
