# Mathematical Modelling in Physiology and Medicine 2021 Coursework

This repository contains the Python code to reproduce the figures in the coursework for [EMATM0007: Mathematical Modelling in Physiology and Medicine](https://www.bris.ac.uk/unit-programme-catalogue/UnitDetails.jsa;jsessionid=557B7CD21C5BEDD4093DA92C0DA5C5F4?ayrCode=31%2F32&unitCode=EMATM0007) by Vedang Joshi.

In this work, we conduct a model comparison and analysis on the paper [Minimal model for signal-induced Ca2+ oscillations and for their frequency encoding through protein phosphorylation](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/87/4/1461.full.pdf). We introduce the biological model in terms of a system of ODEs and compare model approaches to ones found in the literature. We conduct show how the system dynamics change in time for various parameter sets. We give a phase plane analysis to qualitatively determine features in the non-linear system. We end by conducting a bifurcation analysis on the system of ODEs.
